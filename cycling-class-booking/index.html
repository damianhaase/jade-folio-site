					<h1>Cycling Class Booking Engine</h1>
					<p>Currently, there are about 34,000 members taking cycling classes at Equinox, and over 100,000 bikes are being booked online each month (as of August 2015). Since the launch of ‘The Pursuit by Equinox’, interactive real-time game-like cycling classes, attendance has quadrupled. Two-thirds of members book bikes for the classes via the iPhone app, so keeping the app’s booking flow seamless and easy with each feature update is one of my responsibilities as a UX designer. The app has undergone many revisions since I joined three years ago.</p>

				<h2>Current Version of Bike Booking Flow</h2>
				<p>There is  an extreme sense of urgency when booking a bike, because cycling classes are popular. Booking is only available 26 hours before the class, and most members have their own preferences on a bike or general area within the classroom. It’s not uncommon to see classes to fill up within a couple minutes after the booking period starts. Giving the users full control from the countdown ticking to booking, and allowing them  to book their favorite bikes as quick as possible, are the critical user experience.</p>

				<h2>Periodic User Testing &amp; Analysis</h2>
				<p>Feature updates are frequent, and class structures change periodically. Recently, some popular non-cycling classes became available to be booked online as well. The section where you book bikes was called “book a bike”, so the name and icon no longer represented the functionality. The section title needed to be reconsidered, and the added booking flow needed to remain intuitive and blend with the existing flow.</p>

				<p>I interviewed 8 members, both cycling class takers and those other soon-to-be online bookable class takers. I wrote the test scenario and observed members. Based on the findings, we made a  bunch of obvious fixes, and back-filled some other interesting observations - such as use of filters and setting reminder to book bikes.</p>

				<h2>Design Iterations</h2>
				<p>As a lead UX designer, my responsibility is doing such testing and reporting the findings to the team. After design iterations and perhaps more testing, the changes are made into the next version releases.</p>

				<p>Another recent feature update included a waitlist - members who missed booking are now able to put themselves onto a waitlist. When that feature was requested, I created a potential flow, then presented to the product team. After a bit of back and forth of fine-tuning and testing, the design was implemented based on technical feasibility and the priority level. </p>

				<h2>Apple Watch Updates</h2>
				<p>Equinox app is also available on Apple Watch. I was responsible for making sure the design of the flow is in line with Apple’s guidelines and that it is easy to use in such a small interface on the go. The app was initially designed without UX design input as a stripped-down version of iOS app. After my UX feedback, all of the issues with misuse of navigational items compared to Apple’s guidelines were addressed and implemented.</p>
				<p>The app was featured on Apple Watch official commercial as well.</p>
