					<h1>Pilates Purchase</h1>
					<p>The technology team suggested to our business to convert the Private Pilates program to run more digitally after three years of running the Personal Training (PT) digital operations successfully.</p>
					<p>PT members are able to purchase, automatically repurchase, purchase in bulk, and check their remaining balance of different tiers of sessions via their web account and the iOS app. Due to this automation, PT is now the highest revenue-generating sector at Equinox, currently around $2 billion monthly sales.</p>
					<p>The goal was to similarly allow members to purchase Private Pilates sessions online, and streamline the business through shorter renewal time and percentage of existing sales to move to online channel.</p>

				<h2>Concept Validation</h2>
				<p>The biggest challenge was to communicate and validate the initiative to the business stakeholders; they were not convinced that their customers would purchase online. One of the stakeholders feedback was, “It’s not a good idea. I would not want to buy such a thing online, because…”</p>
				<p>To settle this, I suggested customer research. I composed 11 questions to find out whether Pilates customers would prefer to buy in the clubs or online. Nearly 600 active Personal Pilates clients filled out the survey, and 75% of them answered that they would buy sessions primarily online if it was available. Only 3 people commented that they prefer in-person purchase because they prefer personal interaction.</p>

				<p>I presented designs to the Pilates business stakeholder which were done by another member of my team. The workflow and UI patterns followed the precedent established by the PT design.</p>
				<p>I was an interim UX manager, guiding a UX designer and the product team.</p>
