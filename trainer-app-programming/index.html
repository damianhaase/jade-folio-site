					<h1>Trainer App Programming Tool</h1>
					<p>Trainer App is a web-based responsive application which allows trainers to manage their clients and training sessions. They also plan future weeks and months, report to managers and track past sessions total. Trainers' incentives are heavily dependent on how many sessions they do each pay period or monthly - when they hit milestones, their bonus amount rises, and it determines their full-time status. During my stay at Equinox, Trainer App went through many changes, including the platform being moved from jQuery mobile to Bootstrap responsive web design, and adding the ability to track their next bonus milestones.</p>

				<h2>jQuery Mobile to Bootstrap</h2>
				<p>During my stay at Equinox, Trainer App went through many changes, including platform being moved from jQuery mobile to bootstrap responsive web design, being able to track their next bonus milestones, etc. Trainer App 2.0 updates included menu and navigations which account expandability. Also, refreshing the look from 2 year old bootstrappy interface design. Trainer App 2.0 updates included the new menu system and nav style which supports menu expansion better. Also, refreshing the look from 3 year old bootstrappy interface design with the visual designer’s help.</p>
				<p>This was a jQuery mobile version when I first joined. It was impossibly slow and also there were many limits on UI design.</p>

				<p>We switched the platform to Bootstrap, which made the app much faster and supported many more interactions, including drag &amp; drop. The homepage session tracking visuals got updated so it’s more clear when trainers reach their bonus milestones.</p>

				<h2>Current Tool- Google Spreadsheet</h2>
				<p>When trainers meet with their client, they always plan what they are going to do that day. And those programs typically repeats within 1-5 different programs. Planning currently happens in Google Spreadsheet. Based on numerous interviews and observation, it seemed like Google Spreadsheet was not the most suitable to be used with a tablet (most trainers use tablet because of the mobility). They also have to manually create the columns each time and type actuals in the cell which is hard to do. There is really no easy way of sharing samples so there were not much standards. Each trainer had a different workflow, whichever worked best for them. The new functionality will be embedded into the Trainer App, which will be the biggest challenge in back-end and front-end, however, far more seamless experience for trainers.</p>

				<h2>Browse Library</h2>
				<p>Being able to browse pre-made programs by Equinox PT Board was the most exciting thing to trainers when the concept was shown around. Depending on the duration, focus and purpose, they can easily filter down sample workout plans and jump start their program.</p>

				<h2>Create A New Program</h2>
				<p>Trainers can also create a new program if they don’t want to pick one from the library. The biggest overhaul was creating exercise libraries, which make up a program. Each exercise was given attributes - level, movement type, body region, equipments, Functional Movement Screen (FMS), fascial line, etc. With this new database, trainers can search for an exercise to add to their unique program. Trainers will create basic info of the program, set duration, compose exercises and use that as their own signature program.</p>

				<h2>Edit A Program</h2>
				<p>Trainers can also pick a program from the library, make any changes on instances (sets, reps, order, repetitions, etc) and save as a new program. If they don’t find an exercise in exercise library, they can submit one for a review to be included in the global library. Admin members will review the validity and either accept or deny. All of these flows were accounted for in UX design and documented.</p>
