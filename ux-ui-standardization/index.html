					<h1>Equinox UX UI Standardization</h1>
					<p>Design standards and guidelines at Equinox went through an update recently.</p>
					<p>The previous standards were incomplete in places, and out-of-date in other places. The documents were internally-hosted HTML files, and since not everybody on the team could easily edit HTML, the information had fallen behind compared to the current site design. The new standards needed to be easily updated by anyone on the team with edit tracking, and also to be easily sharable, especially with the offshore developers and third party vendors.</p>
					<p>I led the UX team to recreate the standards docs using Google Sites. The new documentation is more easily accessible and collaborative, since all team members already have Google Business accounts. It doesn't require publishing or editing in HTML. Every week, the team meets to discuss any new or updated topics and vet new standards as a group.</p>

				<h2>So Many Buttons</h2>
				<p>The reason I initiated this project was to regulate the consistency on both visual and interaction design. I realized how necessary the documentation is while  working on a project which was handed over to an offshore developer. When we received the pages, they looked visually just like the wireframes we had handed off, instead of like the production site. I realized that the communication between the design team and dev team were lacking. That particular developer may have not known that this was a wireframe and that he should not have taken it as a visual guidelines. I wondered why he didn&rsquo;t just pick a button style from any standard list. </p>
				<p>I started identifying how many buttons styles we had on the live site, and realized that we had been creating new buttons  each time we make any new pages. Below is the my inventory of  unique buttons. There were just too many. 	</p>

				<h2>Living Document</h2>
				<p>The previous guidelines were also incomplete. For example, there was no documentation on radio buttons at all. In one case, where a radio button should have been used, a checkbox was used instead.</p>
				<p>Also, in previous version, there was a rule regarding the use of text links vs. command buttons - it stated that “For editing, if there is one field, use a text link. If there is more than one field, use a command button.” This rule seemed arbitrary and improper. Instead, I suggested to limit the use of command buttons only for committing actions, such as &lsquo;delete, save, purchase&rsquo; and text link for changing the state of modules, such as &lsquo;edit, view as...&rsquo; or link to other page, such as &lsquo;go to this page&rsquo;.</p>
				<p>This project is still in progress.</p>
